Blackjack Web Game
Welcome to the Blackjack Web Game repository! 🎮🃏

This project is the result of my first-ever web development course in college, completed during my first period. It marks the beginning of my journey into coding and development, and I'm excited to share it with you. This simple yet engaging game implements the classic Blackjack game mechanics, fully built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 Features
Classic Blackjack Mechanics: Play the popular card game with the traditional rules.
Interactive Gameplay: Click buttons to draw cards, end the bet, or forfeit the game.
Dynamic Interface: The game updates in real-time with the player's and dealer's cards and scores.
Restart Option: After each round, click the "Restart" button to start a new game without refreshing the page.
Card Shuffling: Utilizes Fisher-Yates shuffle to ensure a randomized deck every time the game is played.
📋 Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure and content for the game interface.
CSS3: Styling the game elements for an engaging user experience.
JavaScript (ES6): The backbone of the game logic, including functions to manage the deck, player actions, hand value calculations, and more.
🎮 How to Play
Upon starting the game, the player and dealer are each dealt two cards.
You can choose to:
Draw a card: Click the "Draw Card" button to get a new card.
End your bet: Once you're satisfied with your hand, click the "End Bet" button to finish your turn.
Forfeit: If you're not feeling lucky, you can quit by clicking the "Forfeit" button.
After the player ends the bet, the dealer will play their hand based on preset rules (drawing cards until they reach 17 or higher).
The winner is determined based on who has the highest hand value without exceeding 21.
🔄 Restarting the Game
Click the Restart button to reset the game and start a new round! No need to refresh the page.

🏆 Future Improvements
Add a score tracker to keep track of wins and losses.
Implement multiple player support for multiplayer functionality.
Improve the visuals with animations and card graphics.
Add a mobile-responsive design for an enhanced experience on different devices.
